            <h3>1. Each team will be asked 5 questions. If the questions are not answered, they will
            get passed on to the next teams.<br><br>
            2. Correct answers will be awarded with 10 points. For the questions that are passed,
            the teams will be awarded with 5 points for each correct response.<br><br>
            3. The participants should be audible and clear when they respond to a question.
            Inaudibility, lack of clarity or confusion in answering the question will be taken as an
            incorrect response.<br><br>
            4. A teamâ€™s first response will be taken as their final answer.<br><br>
            5. If the pronunciation of the answer is not understood by the panel of judges, the
            team may be requested to spell out their responses.<br><br>
            6. The participants can respond to the questions only when the question is read
            completely. Interruption of any kind in between will lead to the cancellation of the
            question to the team.</h3><br><br>
